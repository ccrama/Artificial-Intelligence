Explanation for The Evaluation Moves
-------------------------------------

While evaluating the utility for a state, I took 3 things into consideration. 

1) Score: The total score the user is scoring

2) Total Possible Moves: Taking the freedom of the players peices into consideration.
	If there is no way the player can play score a connect 4 in that column, 
	the AI will give that state a lower utility value.

3)Total moves more needed to score a connect 4: In this I am calculating the number of
	more moves the player needs to make in that state to gain more series of 4.

After obtaining the values, I used the following criteria after trail and error to
evaluate the score

Utility: score*10 + (100/total moves needed to score 4) + (total possible moves/100);
